# Student-data-base-application

Scenario: You are a Database Administrator for a university and need to
create an application to manage student enrollments and balance

My application should do the following:

🥎Ask the user how many new students will be added to the database /n


🥎 The user should be prompted to enter the name and year for each student

🥎 The student should have a 5-digit unique ID, with the first number being their grade level
🥎A student can enroll in the following courses:
🥎Each course costs $600 to enroll
🥎The student should be able to view their balance and pay the tuition
🥎To see the status of the student, we should see their name, ID, courses enrolled, and balance
